2,DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KEYWORDS ‘VAR’ AND ‘DYNAMIC’?,‘Var’ is introduced in C# (3.0) and ‘Dynamic’ is introduced in C# (4.0),‘Var’ is a type of variable where declaration is done at compile time by compiler while,For ‘Var’ Error is caught at compile time and for ‘Dynamic’ Error is caught at runtime,All of Above,O4
3,"Scope of variable is related to definition of variable as:
i. Region of code within which variable value is valid and hence can be accessed.
ii. No, relation with region where variable is declared its value is valid in entire scope.",1,2,"1,2",None,O1
4,Syntax for declaration and initialization of data variable is?,<data type><var_name> = <Value>;,<data type><var_name>;,<var_name><data type>;,<var_name> = <value>;,O1
5,Which data type should be more preferred for storing a simple number like 35 to improve execution speed of a program?, sbyte,short,int   ,long,O1
6,"Correct way to assign values to variable ‘c’ when int a=12, float b=3.5, int c;",c = a + b;,c = a + int(float(b));,c = a + convert.ToInt32(b);,c = int(a + b);,O3
7,Default Type of number without decimal is?,Long Int,Unsigned Long,Int,Unsigned Int,O3
8,"What will be the output of the following C# code? static void Main(string[] args)
 {
     float a = 10.553f;
     long b = 12L;
     int  c;
     c = Convert.ToInt32(a + b);
     Console.WriteLine(c);
 }",23.453,22,23,22.453,O3
9,Select a convenient declaration and initialization of a floating point number:,float somevariable = 12.502D,float somevariable = (Double) 12.502D,float somevariable = (float) 12.502D, float somevariable = (Decimal)12.502D,O3
